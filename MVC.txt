The Model View Controller Pattern
    - makes development more manageable
    - allow for several developerers to simultaneously work on the app
    - scalable, maintainable, and easy to expand


Model: the backend that contains all the data logic
    - simply manage the data 
    - database, API, JSON obj

View: the frontend or graphical user interface (GUI)
    - decide what the user will see on their screen, and how
    - ex. init(), render(), handleClick()

Controller: the brains of the application that controls how data is displayed
    - pull, modify and provide data to the user
    - link between the view and model
    - pulls data from the model and initializes the views, through getter and setter functions
    - it modifies the data with a setter function, if there are any updates from the views
